# Turtle Up Edutainment Game

## Overview
The **Turtle Up Edutainment Game** is an interactive educational game designed to raise awareness about sea turtle conservation, migration, and the impacts of pollution. This game is targeted at a wide audience, including children, adults, and local professionals, with the goal of fostering greater awareness and inspiring action to protect sea turtles and their habitats.

### Game Concept
The game simulates the journey of a sea turtle navigating polluted, trash-filled waters, facing challenges such as distinguishing between food and trash. It also highlights the role humans play in either exacerbating or alleviating these problemsâ€”by throwing trash into the environment, cleaning up the beaches, and how their actions impact the turtle's survival.

## Project Goals
- **Raise awareness** about the **life cycle** and **migration patterns** of sea turtles.
- **Educate players** about the **real-world threats** sea turtles face, such as **pollution** and **habitat destruction**.
- **Highlight the ecological importance** of sea turtles in **marine and beach ecosystems**.
- **Provide an engaging educational experience** that inspires action to protect sea turtles and their habitats.

## Features
- **Interactive gameplay** where players experience both **human and turtle perspectives**.
- **Human perspective (Level 1)**: Players clean up beaches, sort trash, and learn about the environmental impact.
- **Turtle perspective (Level 2)**: Players navigate polluted waters, scavenging for food while avoiding trash and obstacles.
- **Educational content** is integrated throughout the game, teaching players about conservation and the impact of pollution.
